*Relative: It means that the element is in the normal flow of things .
*Absolute: It means that the element is in accordance with its ancestor or if there is no positioning in the ancestor then it takes the body .

*when i give absolute i am actually overridding the margin:auto and it has to be positioned with respect to the nearest ancestor .

* If i give relative and margin:auto then the element will be positioned relative to its margin .
