              Development began soon after the release of Sonic and Knuckles in 1994,
               although the concept originated during the development of Sonic the
              Hedgehog 2 (1992). Development was led by Sonic Team veterans Yuji Naka,
              Naoto Ohshima, and Takashi Iizuka. Naka began the project with the main idea revolving
              around flight, and Ohshima designed the character Nights to resemble an angel that
              could fly like a bird. Ohshima designed Nights specifically as an androgynous character.
